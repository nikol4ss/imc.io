## IMC.io
This project marks my first hands-on experience with JavaScript. It consists of a BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator, developed during the initial stages of learning programming logic and core JavaScript concepts. The project demonstrates basic input handling, calculations, and DOM manipulation, serving as a foundation for understanding fundamental programming principles."
